Colours have been scientifically proven to make us feel a type of way in response to different colours. Big brands and companies have used this knowledge to capitalise on this.



One prime food restaurant that does this is Mcdonalds. Their simple ‘M’, is a yellow tone which has been scientifically proven to make a human feel hungry. It seems almost illegal when explaining the trickery they use to our brains in order to sell their products.

Each colour has a different trait. Blue represents loyalty and trust. That’s why most banks have the primary colour of blue on their logo, they want to be perceived as trustful and loyal to their customer base as the potential customer will store all their life savings into their banks. Examples of these banks are Halifax, Metro Bank, Barclays and many more. It is an ongoing pattern to use the same colours as other established brands in your category. This is because the potential customer can learn to associate them together and understand what they represent. A bright pink bank would not work. It would give childish, irresponsible connotations to the brand. Moreover, people would hardly realise it was a bank in the first place.



Without a correct style of typography colour is pretty much useless. Contrasting typography and colour can leave a person looking at the brand very confused and lacking idea of what the brand is trying to suggest.



The typography needs to replicate what the brand is trying to represent or is in fact. If the brand is bold, brave and daring, you would expect the font to be bold and each letter to be quite heavy. Or if your brand represented elegance, maybe a lighter weighted font with soft edges in each turn of a letter, maybe even a handwritten-style font would be appropriate. In addition to this a brand should consider using a similar or the same typeface throughout their branding. On their websites, leaflets, billboards; they all should look the same in relation to their typeface family.



Typography with the additional help of colour helps give the brand a visual identity that the whole world can understand and appreciate. It is important to note that the colour and the typography go hand in hand with one another to create a brand. Once you have outlined an image for your brand others will recognise it for that specific style and it will be established.

Rilikoss media is established two key components. One is that it is bold. That's why when you click on the website you will see a heavy brand name that sticks into your head with its bold red colour. I specifically chose the colour red so that it is given to the audience as a warning. The reader will understand the importance of the information stated and posted onto the website. The typography is playful, which leads me onto my next component. Youthful target audience. The font is playful, which gives the audience something to relate and adapt to. This theme is continued throughout the website so that the brand's identity is engraved in the audience's head. This is because typography is the identity of the brand. If there are any imbalances and contradicting typography styles then it is almost like you do not believe in your own brand and its meaning. Consistency is key.





What do all colours mean?



Green gives a feeling of nature.

Blue gives a feeling of loyalty and calmness.

Yellow gives a feeling of happiness and as we now know, hunger.

Red gives a feeling of danger, it has connotations to blood. It is very common for colours to represent what we see on our Earth.

Black means bravery. A lot of countries establish their flags with these colours.Purple gives a feeling of royalty and wealth.

Pink gives feelings of softness and femininity, which is why a lot of beauty brands have pink logos.
