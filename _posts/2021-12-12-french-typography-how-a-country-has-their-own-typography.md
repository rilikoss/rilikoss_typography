When you think of France, you think of elegance. You think of Paris. You think of fine architecture. Amazing fashion. You also think of shops and good restaurants. Each little cafe, shop, restaurant has their own name printed in a common typography style seen throughout France. 



French typography signifies elegance of the highest form. There are many distinguishing features that outline and give evidence that a piece of text is of French heritage, without it being in actual French. One detail seen in most letters is a beak on the end of letters, for example the curve on the letter ‘r’ will most likely end with a beak-like shape. This form gives the letter that posh look. It also gives the impression that the letter is aged or has history, and to the french history is very important. Foots are very common as well. The bottom line of any letter, unless curved at the bottom, has a foot. A foot literary works like the human foot in typography too. It gives the letter something to stand on, this creates this bold, firm stance in the font.



If you stroll through the streets of Paris, you are bound to see shops branded with a common style of writing seen throughout the whole of France. They are usually in black writing to replicate that handwritten in ink effect. This gives an old vibe to the shops. Even with many well established franchises, like Louis Vuitton, you see a changed appropriate style to suit the nationalities culture. The main reason that France does this is to reestablish their chique fashion. France is one of the biggest producers of high-end fashion. 



France’s architecture is another example of how the French have preserved the past. The buildings are examples of fine plan and art. Million and billion euro buildings surround the Eiffel Tower and they all suit one another. Most of Paris is not ruined by tall ugly skyscrapers and they have mirrored this attribute in their texts as well. 



Even though France is an amazing example of embedding their personality into their typography, it is not the only country to do this. In England for example, Oxford has preserved this vintage-look in the city centre. Barber shops, Tailors, Estate Agents, cafes, restaurants, all look like they haven’t been touched since the 1950s. However, London on the other hand has the complete opposite. One reason this has occurred is because London is a very big city with a lot of diversity. There are people of all types of backgrounds in London, and those people decide to open shops and when they hang their banner it represents themselves. This is not a bad thing though. If you walk through one street in the big city you can feel like you are in tens of thousands of different places at the same time.



Typography can be the image of a country. From each letter printed in public view, a message is sent. If not done correctly the message can be very negative, but if done correctly you can brand your country in a positive and beautiful way. Canvases of typography are spread everywhere in countries; from street signs to shop fronts, from door numbers to advertisements on billboards. Typography is everywhere.
