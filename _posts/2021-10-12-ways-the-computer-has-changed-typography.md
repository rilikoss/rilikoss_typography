Fonts are created by artists which have carefully styled and sized each letter. With the development of technology, we see a major change in the fonts created and used compared to fonts used in the past prior to the inventions of such things as the computer.

Computer screens are displayed by pixels, some computers have higher resolution whilst others have less. This is important when picking a typeface because some typefaces are harder to read when there is a lower resolution. The characteristics of a font could also determine if the text is legible; it is important to think of these, which are:

* weight
* contrast
* width
