Calligraphy art is a growing form of art in the typography world. It has also gained popularity on social media, people are now posting videos of their amazing calligraphy skills all over facebook, instagram, etc.



This art form has taken a new turn. It used to historically be a natural thing. A Lord would get one of his scribes to write a letter, they would write in their fountain pens, and it would create an amazing effect only possible with that kind of pen and handwriting skill. This skill has now been replicated into our computers. However, every letter is computerised and the same so the natural effect loses its character. Is the computer making calligraphy die out?



A lot of people are now fighting back and posting their artistic skills online. Simple videos of calligraphy artists handwriting words are trending on social media. The aesthetically pleasing pen to paper look is what racks up the views. On TikTok they are labelled as satisfying videos and have come under this big trend of watching videos that make you feel ‘satisfied’. 



Calligraphy is now turning into a business. People are selling their work of calligraphy skills on the internet. With random items being personalised with calligraphy. These products are very highly valued because of the great demand for them. For example, a candle with a handwritten message can cost up to £50. This is not just a type of typography becoming popular it is a business opportunity to pounce on.



The way a fountain pen works gives this font a unique style. Depending on the direction the pen is angled, the weight of the letter becomes heavier or lighter/ thicker or thinner. Some letters end more exaggeratedly with a longer tail. For example, the letter ‘Q’ when a capital the line between tends to extend almost like a feather. In addition, to achieve a beautiful design some words may start with a letter with a ‘swash’. You can find these on letters like ‘b’, where the top swerves to the left to give the letter character and almost make it look like a snake. Arcing of stems is very common because of the way the fountain pen works. For example, a lowercase ‘j’, may be thinner towards the bottom because of the way the pen moves to the left in order to complete the tail of the ‘j’. Tear drop terminals are now also implemented on computers as well as handwritten pieces. This has been possible due to the increase in specification of pixels on computer screens allowing the small details to be visible and not conjoined together. The reason it is seen in calligraphy is because the ink starts releasing more at the end of letters, creating a sort of splurge on the paper.



All in all the world is adapting to new times by not forgetting the aesthetics of the old. This is beautiful in many ways. It means we do not forget how things were because we have risen in technology. However, in the future I can predict that this trend will die out as people crave more simple fonts. The main reason is because it is easier to read for the average person, and also it is much easier for the computer to display.
