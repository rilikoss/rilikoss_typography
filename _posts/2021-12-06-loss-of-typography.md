Typography is losing its use slowly in our world. We’ve almost gone back in time where words were pictures, like when the Egyptians had hieroglyphics. Of course, if not evident enough I am talking about the take-over of emojis.

Emojis are now one of the most common keyboards and it is universal. Visuals like these emoticons are understood by almost everyone around the world and most cultures share the same emotions on their faces so the emojis replicate almost every culture. On the other hand, typography is different in different countries. For example, if the text is big and bold in some traditions it almost means you have something to hide with a big gesture. This is seen in Bosnian culture, where if something makes a bold statement or a big gesture it is harder to trust them because they believe it is unnecessary for big statements. 

Emoticons replace a lot of words in our dictionary. However, it also helps us express our feelings easier and simpler through pictures. Compared to trying to write paragraphs to try and explain what you are feeling. So the meaning isn’t lost in text. Most smartphones when texting give you the option to replace a word you have written with an emoji, this is located right above the keyboards in the suggestions and prediction box. 

We are in a world where time and technology is very important to keeping up with the earth’s needs. We are apparent to the fact that our attention span is shortened by the rush and content of our technologies, smartphones particularly. Our earth requires us to cut corners and be the quickest we can when communicating, emojis may be the way we can achieve this. The encouragement is obvious but will there ever be a time where the world can all communicate with each other with this one language, a language of emoticons?



I believe it is way too early for this to be discussed. However, introducing it now into our world and making the human race apparent to this new language is a good idea. This is because humans need to adapt to new things over time. It is a very slow and gradual process. Each younger generation uses emoticons more and more each year. The commonality is stated in trends and also pictured throughout all social media. It is rare to see someone's post now commented on with words it's always a heart-eyes emoji, or the fire emoji. Language is being lost but a new language is being formed.



The new Macs now have an easily accessible touch pad on the top of the keyboard that you can access to use emojis.



The saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Funnily enough the emoticons reach both sides of this saying in a way. We even have moving emojis. Mostly seen on facebook posts, when your old aunt comments under your pictures with a dog blowing a kiss gif. I’m not saying this is groundbreaking but it saves her typing two words for half an hour so there are some benefits.



The most commonly used emoji in 2021 has been the emoji laughing with tears of joy. Mainly because imagine every time you wanted to laugh at something over text you would go, “hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha”.

If not so obvious in the last paragraph and the few others before, emojis are taking over. But will we see it become more common for words other than feelings. It is easy to find a picture of nouns but what about other types of lexis. Will the future mean we communicate less by mouth and more through texts over the phone. Will we lose all sense of typography?
